    "## Advanced Query Operators ##\n",
    "Using advance query operators in MongoDB can help us to gain more flexible control over the documents in a MongoDB database. First we will look at comparison operators that can be used to conditionally retrieve documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the usage of the following operators: `$eq, $lt, $lte, $gt, $gte, $in, $nin, and $not`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### \\$eq\n",
    "First, we will learn how we can use $eq. This operator matches values that are equal to a specified value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following queries documents whose `yearOfUni` is equal to 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.FIT_COMPLEX.find ({yearOfUni: {$eq: 2}})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply, this is equivalent to the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.FIT_COMPLEX.find ({yearOfUni: 2})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use $eq to a field in embedded documents. For example, let's select all documents where the first name is equal to \"Marie\". To specify a condition on the a field in an embedded document, use the dot notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.FIT_COMPLEX.find ({\"name.first\": {$eq: \"Marie\"}})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The query is also equivalent to:\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.FIT_COMPLEX.find ({\"name.first\": \"Marie\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \\$lt and \\$lte\n",
    "If you want to find all students whose previous marks are less than 80, then execute the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.FIT_COMPLEX.find({\"result.mark\":{\"$lt\":80}})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\"$lte\" can be used to match values that are \"less than or equal to\" a specified value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \\$gt and \\$gte\n",
    "\\$gt and \\$gte stand for 'greater than' and 'greater than or equal to' respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>\n",
    "**Exercise**: Find all students whose previous marks are greater than or equal to 90.\n",
    "</font><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \\$in and \\$nin\n",
    "If we want to find all students whose `yearOfUni` is either class 2 or 3, then run the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.FIT_COMPLEX.find({\"yearOfUni\":{\"$in\":[2, 3]}})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "**Exercise**: Let’s find students who are not 2 or 3 year of uni.\n",
    "</font><br>\n",
    "\n",

    "**Exercise**: Let’s combine all of the above operators and write a query. Find all students that are either MIT or MDS students; these students must be either 3 or 4 year of unit; and also, at least the previous marks should be greater than or equal to 90. Note that at least you need to use \"\\$in\" and \"$or\" once for this query.\n",

    "## Regular Expressions ##\n",
    "Now, we will learn how to use **regular expressions** in MongoDB. Regular expressions can be used for searching for a pattern of word in any string. MongoDB also provides functionality of regular expression for string pattern matching using the `$regex` operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples. In the `FIT_COMPLEX` collection, if you want to find all students with their course name including “MD” or “MI”, then we can design a query like:\n",

    "db.FIT_COMPLEX.find({\"course\":/(MD|MI)/i})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand the syntax of the above query:\n",

    "- (MD|MI): the course name string must include with either “MD” or “MI”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, using `$regex`, the above query can be written as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.FIT_COMPLEX.find({\"course\":{$regex: \"(MD|MI)\", $options:\"$i\"}})\n",
    "```\n",
    "As can be seen, to search for a string in the case insensitive manner, we need to use `$options` with its value as `$i`.\n",

    "<font color='blue'>\n",
    "**Exercise**: Let’s find students with their names including with \"Da\" or \"Jo\".\n",

    "- \"course\":/(MD$): all course names ending with 'MD'\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>\n",
    "**Exercise**: Let’s find students with their course names staring with \"MD\". Also, let's find students with their course names ending with \"DS\". \n",

    "db.FIT_COMPLEX.find({\"course\":/(DS$)/})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>\n",
    "**Exercise**: Next, let’s complicate the query a bit. Let’s combine it with the operators covered above.\n",
    "Find students whose first names starting with 'A', 'J' or 'D'; their years of uni are greater than 2; and completed units with their names including 'Data'. You don't need to consider \"case-sensitive\" for this search.\n",

    "\n",

    "What's the result? Yes we got two students: 'sid=123' and 'sid=124'. How can we combine information from different collections together? To answer this question, we can build a embedding data model by writing some code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take through the following steps and write some code on the `mongo` shell:\n",
    "- Pick up a student from the `users` collection, \n",
    "- Get the information about that student, and \n",
    "- Combine it with a list of units from the `units` collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "var unitCode = \"FIT9132\"\n",
    "var unitObj = db.units.findOne({\"unit_code\":unitCode}) // find the unit\n",
    "unitObj.studentList = [] // create an emptry array\n",
    "var studentList = db.users.find({\"completed_units\":unitCode}) // find students having the unitCode\n",
    "studentList.forEach(function(student) { // for each student in the studentList\n",
    "... unitObj.studentList.push(student) // push that student into the unitobj.studentList array\n",
    "... })\n",
    "> unitObj\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyse the above code. First, we have the unit code, `FIT9132`. Then, we find the unit document having this unit code. There are two students who completed this unit, `sid=123` and `sid=124`. Then, we combine the information together using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarise. MongoDB enables us to use two options for designing a data model: `embedding` and `referencing`. In our exercise, in the embedding design, we stored the student information in a unit document as we did in the code above. On the other hand, in the referencing design, you could normalise the model a bit by referencing the unit information in the `users` collection (i.e. our original data model: `users` and '`units`).\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the benefit of using the embedding approach? We can store and retrieve all the related data a single seek. However, in some cases, a referencing model may work better - one benefit is that we can increase flexibility when querying the data. "
